= 1.0.4 - 2013/04/22 =
* Tweak - Added when install and activate plugin link redirects to License Key activation pop-up. Once validated redirects to the Store > Presentation options page where the WP e-Commerce Grid View settings are instead of the wp-plugins dashboard which has caused confusion as users do not realize that WP Grid View has no settings.
* Tweak - Tested all plugin code 100% compatible with new WP e-Commerce version 3.8.10
* Tweak - Updated some 404 links from plugins readme and dashboard.
* Fix - Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing the activation pop-up to show a -1 error because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Predictive Search now automatically detects that and works as it should.
